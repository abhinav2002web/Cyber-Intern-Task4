Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Linux

Objective : Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffics.
Tools :UFW (uncomplicated firewall) on Linux.
Deliverables : Screenshots


1. Open firewall configuration tool
	We're using UFW through the terminal.

2. List current firewall rules
	sudo ufw status numbered

3. Add a rule to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet)
	sudo ufw deny 23

4. Test the rule
	telnet localhost 23

5. Allow SSH on port 22
	sudo ufw allow 22

6. Remove test block rule
	sudo ufw delete deny 23

7. Document all commands used
	sudo apt install ufw
	sudo ufw enable
	sudo ufw status numbered
	sudo ufw deny 23
	telnet localhost 23
	sudo ufw allow 22
	sudo ufw delete deny 23


8. Summary of how UFW filters traffic

UFW works by allowing or denying traffic on specific ports or IP addresses. Rules are evaluated in order, and it filters inbound and outbound traffic based on user-defined rules.
